# Learning Machine Learning

This repository is a structured, hands-on record of my journey learning **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**.  
It combines **clear theoretical explanations** with **practical implementations** to bridge the gap between concepts and real-world code.

The goal of this repository is not just to show *how* algorithms work, but *why* they work — building intuition alongside implementation.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

Each topic is covered from two complementary perspectives:

- **📘 Conceptual Notes**  
  Intuitive explanations of machine learning concepts, mathematical foundations, and design choices.

- **💻 Practical Code**  
  Clean, minimal implementations using Python, along with Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.

Topics progress from fundamentals to more advanced material, making the repository suitable for:
- Beginners starting their ML journey
- Practitioners revising core concepts
- Anyone looking for concise, well-documented references

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The repository is organized as a learning path and includes (but is not limited to):

- Mathematical foundations (linear algebra, probability, calculus)
- Supervised learning (linear/logistic regression, k-NN, SVMs)
- Unsupervised learning (k-means, clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Model evaluation and validation
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Optimization techniques
- Advanced topics (transformers, reinforcement learning, interpretability)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The content is organized to clearly separate theory from practice:

- `notes/` → Detailed explanations and learning notes  
- `code/` → Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks  
- `datasets/` → Sample datasets and dataset references  
- `references/` → Papers, books, and external resources

Each concept typically includes:
1. A written explanation in `notes/`
2. One or more implementations in `code/`
3. (When helpful) a notebook demonstrating experiments or visualizations
